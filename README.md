Project Reqiurements:


Purpose of this project is to  demonstrate an excellent understanding of designing a relational database and manipulating the database definition.
Summary: I have been hired by an organization to analyze their membership database. As part of the analysis, I am required to design an analytical database (Adams_ext). Adams is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to safeguarding the employment rights of its members. I have been offered the following description about Adams_ext:
• Adams collects the data of some key attributes about their members: membership number, name, address, phone, email, registered date, salary, and membership status.
• Adams keeps track of the members’ employment history. Thus, a member may have been part of several employers, and there may be one or more employees having or having had a contract with a given employer. Adams records each member’s employment start date and end date with a given employer (contract) and whether the contract is currently active or not.
• Membership fees are charged annually, and Adams maintains a separate account (payments) to record each payment. Each payment denotes the date until with the membership is covered by the payment (membership valid until). Members may have gaps in their memberships and remain as inactive members.
• Adams also records the cases filed by each member. SOME of the data related to these cases include case number, description, filed date, type, and status.
Project Requirements:
1. Design an ERD using the traditional UML notation. Ensure to include all the mentioned attributes, other relevant attributes, keys, and relationships. 
2. Based on the ERD designed, create the MySQL database Adams_ext. 
3. Insert test data into all the tables in Adams_ext . 
4. After inserting data, i noticed that i need make some alterations. Performed modifications to the database without dropping any table:
